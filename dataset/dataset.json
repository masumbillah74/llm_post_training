        "input": "​Erling Haaland has been a dominant force in Fantasy Premier League (FPL) since his arrival at Manchester City in the 2022/23 season. Here's a detailed breakdown of his FPL points accumulation and performance analysis by gameweek across all seasons up to the current gameweek.​ 2022/23 Season: Haaland's debut season in the Premier League was nothing short of spectacular. He amassed a total of 272 FPL points, making him the highest-scoring player that season. His performance was characterized by consistent goal-scoring and multiple double-digit hauls.​ Gameweeks 1-5: Haaland made an immediate impact, scoring nine goals in his first five matches. Notably, he secured back-to-back hat-tricks in Gameweeks 4 and 5 against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest, earning 17 points in each of those gameweeks. ​ Mid-Season (Gameweeks 6-19): He continued his prolific form, though there was a slight dip in his goal-scoring rate. Haaland scored 13 goals during this period, averaging approximately 6-8 points per gameweek.​ Second Half (Gameweeks 20-38): Opponents began to adapt to his style of play, leading to a marginal decrease in his output. He scored 14 goals in these gameweeks, with his FPL points dropping from 153 in the first half to 119 in the second half of the season. ​ 2023/24 Season: Building on his inaugural season, Haaland continued to be a pivotal FPL asset. He accumulated a total of 250 FPL points, showcasing his consistency and importance to FPL managers.​ Gameweeks 1-10: Haaland started the season strongly, averaging around 8 points per gameweek. His performances included multiple goals and assists, reinforcing his status as a must-have player.​ Gameweeks 11-20: During this period, there was a noticeable dip in his returns. Over six gameweeks, he accumulated only 19 points, leading some managers to consider alternative premium assets. ​ Gameweeks 21-38: Haaland regained his form, delivering several double-digit hauls and finishing the season on a high note. His resilience and ability to bounce back made him a reliable captaincy choice in the latter stages.​ 2024/25 Season (Current Season up to Gameweek 11): As of Gameweek 11 in the 2024/25 season, Haaland has maintained his reputation as a top FPL performer.​ Gameweeks 1-5: He dominated all major goal threat metrics, leading in shots, shots on target, and big chances. His consistent performances made him a popular captaincy choice among FPL managers. ​ Gameweeks 6-11: There was a slight decline in his output. Over these six gameweeks, he accumulated 19 points, while other premium assets like Mohamed Salah outscored him with 58 points in the same period. This led to discussions among FPL managers about potentially transferring him out to accommodate in-form players. ​ Performance Analysis: Haaland's FPL journey has been marked by explosive starts in each season, followed by periods where his returns slightly diminished. This pattern suggests that while he is a formidable asset, there are phases where diversifying captaincy options or considering other premium players might be beneficial. His performance against varying defensive strengths indicates that he thrives against teams with weaker defenses, often delivering double-digit hauls. However, against more robust defenses, his goal-scoring frequency tends to decrease, although he still contributes through assists and overall play.​​",
